# Inedo.DBGen

Inedo.DBGen is a lightweight ORM that's used by Inedo product engineers to generate
stored procedure wrappers (DB.cs) and table wrappers (Tables.cs) against database that
follow Inedo's to-be-documented database development conventions. While it's unlikely
you will find this project useful, we are open sourcing it as part of our
[open initiative](https://inedo.com/open).
